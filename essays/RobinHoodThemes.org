Robin Hood is one of the most famous legends of all time. It tells about the story of an English outlaw by the name of
Robin Hood and his company and their adventures, of how they steal from the rich (but do not harm them) and give a share
of what they stole to the poor, their good deeds, and their merry time together.
While it seems rather plain at first sight, the tale of Robin Hood is much more complex and rich, as it contains major
themes, motifs, symbols, and irony that aid it in delivering the marvelous experience it does. Even though all of
these contribute to the experience, the themes are the most crucial, as not only do they assist the other elements,
but they also teach quite valuable lessons. The most significant ones are friendship, deception, and morality and legality.^{/(The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood Themes, n.d.)/}


Friendship plays an essential role in the story of Robin Hood. Robin Hood, as mighty as he is, almost never goes on missions
alone without taking one member of his company with him unless doing so puts them in grave peril. Robin and his Merry men
are more like a family than they are friends, as each one cares for the other deeply as if they were brothers.
They always help each other during dire situations, such as when Will Stutely was rescued by his comrades when he was
about to get hanged under the Sheriff's orders. The crew also readily welcomes and new members, usually with a feast.
This great portrayal of friendship shows that friends, family, and friendship play an essential part in our life, and they
should be cherished and preserved as they can be live-saving and vital at times.


Just like in the Odyssey^{/(Sam Khaldoon, n.d.)/}, deception is another tactic often used by Robin and his company to plot their plans
or flee desperate situations; moreover, it portrays the intelligence of the characters in both novels.
In Robin Hood, both the Sheriff, Robin Hood, and his crew try to deceive one another. The Sheriff often arranges contests
to try to capture Robin, but Robin and his Merry Men often deceive the Sheriff and foil his plans. Whatever condition
lands upon them, Robin and his company always outwit it via their cleverness.
Deception in Robin Hood shows that being shrewd and smart can get one out even in the most
extreme occasions, as the power of the mind is not to be underestimated.

The main theme that the tale is known for is morality and legality^{/(The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood Themes, n.d.)/}.
The story revolves around an entire conflict between the law and the protagonists' illegal actions
which are deemed as morally correct. Even though the law provides a guideline under which the people should act, sometimes
the law isn't perfect, or is laid down by biased people such that the law works to their advantage only.
There are many examples of this within the text of the book. The King keeps himself a good pack
of deer, but prevents anyone from touching them other than the other rich people working for him.
The deer could suffice as good food for the poor, yet the king keeps them away from the people with a law stating that any
who kill the King's deer shall have his ears cut.
It is against these immoral actions and laws that Robin Hood constantly fights against.^{/(The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood: Analysis & Themes, 2017)/}
Robin Hood is a thief, yet he steals only from the rich who have extra money to spare and gives a share of it
to those who need it, especially the ones taxed heavily by the King and his men.
He sells meat for cheap and free to the poor, yet demands full price to be paid from the rich.
Even though Robin and his Merry Men are doing illegal acts and are outlaws, they still
are beloved by the people due to their morally just actions.
The tale and this theme raise many questions: are laws ever perfect, should they be broken in certain cases, who should be
considered fit and allowed to lay down laws, and should the law ever conflict with morality?

The tale of Robin Hood is extremely underrated in terms of what it teaches. As famous as it is, the lessons within it are
often neglected. The lessons it conveys via the themes of deception, friendship, and morality versus legality are quite
invaluable and they could help the future generations become much more mindful and righteous.
