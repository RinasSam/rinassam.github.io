AZAKI LORE:
===========================================================================================


Azaki, a middle aged man who is one of the best sorcerers for Chaos after Beyuu came to Inamorta. Azaki tried to kill him but after many attemps he gave up and became Beyuu's right hand man. However, in secret, Azaki was studying Beyuu and learning his weaknesses to create a weapon that can destroy him but things did not go the way he expected. He grew somewhat attached to Beyuu and stopped his production for the weapon. Beyuu, knew that Azaki was going to betray him but when he figured out he gave up, he trusted Azaki more. Azaki studied forbidden chaos magic with beyuu. After Beyuu was betrayed, Azaki tried to revive him and to do that, he viewed the sampled of forbidden chaos magic he studied with Beyuu and with some more studying, he discovered a new mana. He named it after Beyuu's mana, Hell Mana but instead he called his: V's Hell Mana. He then made a book about the forbidden chaos magic and did tests with raider gang leaders who were willing to give their members as a price for money. The general of supply helped Azaki a bit, though Supply did not know his intentions. Azaki split part of his mana and soul into the book. He then revived Beyuu by casting a spell, but to Azaki's surprise, all his mana was used in the spell and thus he lost all his mana and the man he cast it on defeated him easily. Azaki had a scheme he planned to take down everyone. He knew that medusa would die, he set the traps to Medusa's death. His plan was to kill Medusa and all of the generals, he knew that a group of 6-7 people would most likely look after the fort however, Azaki did not expect Rui to consume the book. The part of Azaki in the book including the rest of the souls, went in Rui. After Rui trained with his new chaos magic, he finally gained acess to speak to the souls in him. Azaki spoke to Rui and after something, he was released as a spirit but since a part of Azaki was in Rui, he posessed Rui. 
After posessing Rui, he created another plan. To find the glory key and gain V's hell Mana back. To defeat the Beyuu inside Diocletian (plot twist another beyuu comes for ocean), and to get his weapon to defeat beyuu.

PINNED MESSAGES:
===========================================================================================

however, he tried to kill and betray beyuu before he became his right hand man because he wasn't the type of guy to obey orders but after realizing he was too powerful and it was pointless, he gave up and worked for him. After he started working for him, he tried to learn beyuu's weaknesses and try to form a magic or a weapon that can harm beyuu. However, Azaki grew closer and closer towards Beyuu and decided to stop working on building a weakness. Beyuu slightly knew that Azaki was going to betray him but wanted to make the most use of him but after he realized that Azaki stopped trying to do whatever he was doing to stop him, he liked him.





Vilore™️ (Victor Lore)

Victor was an enslaved miner 15 years before LoC. A mutiny in his workplace happened 5 years later in which he gained his freedom. He ran away from the facility and gathered friends in his adventures. 6 years before LoC he establishes a raider group and calls it the Victor's Legion. It first started with extortion of small businesses but after he gained enough money, he started recruiting criminals to take part in raids. They first started with abandoned villages but moved to small towns after many successful loots. Deserters started joining his raider clan and the Legion was the most powerful raider group after he destroyed all other competitors. Thanks to their large numbers and experience in urban and guerrilla warfare, they are much more daring and are not scared of raiding villages near important military locations. During the Order-Chaos war, the Legion got more members as the desertion rate skyrocketed. As of LoC, the Legion is still active though the number of new members is stagnating.

Man sometimes i think abt the fact that one of the reasons Cyn spared Atren was bcs she wanted to fuck him. And when i think abt it i both think its funny and unnervin.





A man stood in a dark room. His eyes were closed shut.  He was covered in armor and had long hair as well as pointy ears. A large giant was sitting in a room, hiding in the shadows.
"Good job with the screeching Eclipse. However, it seems I still can't pinpoint their locations." The man spoke. 
General Eclipse was guiding a 100 and more Eclipsors in the air, using his ability to speak telepathically with the man.
"However, I can tell what they are. 2 Swordwrath, 1 magikill, a clawrath, 2 shadowrath a juggerknight and a woman with wings. There's also a woman that looks like a villager." The man continued. 
"A woman with wings, and a clawrath....hmmm so the twins are here....."
General Eclipse chuckled to himself. A Juggerknight he wondered. But something was odd to the man, it felt like he knew the juggerknight.
"Very well, gatekeeper, we will move on." The eclipsor spoke.
As the Eclipsor flew far away from the fort.
