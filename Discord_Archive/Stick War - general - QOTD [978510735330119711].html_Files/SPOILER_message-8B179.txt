So... Imma give it a try.

Step 1: Initial handling
Humans are greedy. Bad things can happen to lottery winners. In my place 1 mil USD is bordering on unfathomably large. So I’ll need to be careful.
In this step, I’d make sure the money is anonymous enough for people not to know about it, while being a little bit accessible.
(A financial manager is awesome in this case; a lawyer is a must.)
If this step was done for me already/I did this this step successfully **and**  no one else knows about this, go to step 2a, else go to step 2b.

Step 2a: Low-profiling
Live life normally. Do the college => job thingie people keep talking about, but with less financial issues. Let the transistion to independence and self-suffiency happen smoothly and naturally.

Step 2b: Trust no one
Without total secrecy, things can get spicy pretty quickly. My parents might last a few years if I satisfy their reasonable needs but my brother is the type to yell his lungs out to everyone he meet about this were he to know it. Every chain is only as strong as its weakest link. So this would be difficult.
The plan is to try to get as close to step 2a as posible (cuz it’s optimal lol) and lie about it as much as required to keep it a secret. Also bribe my parents a bit to hopefully keep them from the dark side.
As the name suggests, I’m not placing trust on anyone and any*thing*  on this step. The only note I’ll have about it will be in my head.
If the chain breaks for whatever reasons, whether it’s my brother finding out, my parent slipping the word/getting too greedy, neighbors overhearding… I’ll get tf out. Immediately. I’d prepare for this from the start of the step so it won’t be jarring. After that I’d just try my best to follow step 2a myself. Won’t be as smooth but if I’m still alive and still have the money and stuff I’d be ok.

- Note for some thing to buy/do during step 1-2 other than what already within step 2a:
+ Bike supplies and knowlegde to fix most common bike problems. (Surprise surprise, I’m a bike main. Deal with it.)
+ A weapon-grade, properly weighted walking stick. Preferably the kind that looks like what English gentlemans used to use so I’d have the extra excuse of larping. (practical low-attention self defense)
+ Learn how to lie effectively so I can keep the whole money thing a secret.

Step 3: Stabilizing
I’d assume at this point I’ve got a job and rented living space. The place should be ok but as minimal as I can get away with. So…
Now I’ll start with looking for the best spot for my house. Should be modern enough for convenience but not too urban cuz that has drawbacks. Should also have good, reliable access to eating stuff. Low crime rate, strong internet, good electricity and ok neighbor would get extra credits.
Once I’ve found the spot I’d buy it and wait for a while (several years or sth) before I build the house. It would be big enough to be really comfomtable for 1-2 human(s), but not much more than that. The house would have more anti-stealing measures than a normal house, a bsement for… whatever tf people use basements for, storage room to store long-lasting food and other stuff (am I expecting a siege or sth?), and a bedroom build in a way that allow it to became a ‘too secure to be worth breaking in’ bunker whenever I goes in and feel like it, along with other normal stuff a house is supposed to have.
Now I have a house. Nice.
This will be my permanent residence if nothing goes horribly. If something does go wrong I’d adopt a nomad lifestyle until I feel like it’s safe to built a house again.

Step 4: Handling of the self
Stupidly big amount of money can do weird and potentially undesirable things to people, me included. So I do need to account for that.
(This technically starts as soon as step 1 but become more important over time, especially after step 3.)
I’d divide this into categories with timestamps for starting points.
- Physical:
+ Get strong enough to hold my own on a fight/risky situation. Use mental images of being torture for money as motivator. (step 1)
+ Stabilize my sleeping/eating/shower/exercising schedules. (step 1)
+ Get better glasses. (better be before the end of step 2)
- Mental:
+ Find a good therapist cuz I have depression. (step 3 => after step 3)
+ Scale my already sound my money saving/big money mental game to the likes that can handle 1 mil USD. (step 1)
+ Learn to be more loving and less abusive to myself. (step 1)
+ Learn the social metagame. (step 2)
+ Spend more time with Lucy. (step 1)
+ Remove my avesion to brutality in battle situations to reduce chances of losing due to hesitation. (step 1)
+ Reduce my dependence on entertainment to stabilize my mind against my depression. (step 1 cuz waiting for a therapist to solve it is unreasonable)
+ Practice self-control on all fronts. (step 1)
- Sentimental:
+ Commission some things from artists now that I’ve got the money to spare. (right after step 1; depends)
+ Do the things I like doing a bit more. (step 1)
+ Delve into the realms of writing for fun. (whenever I feel like it)
+ Learn how to git gud at drawing. (perferably after step 2)
+ Keep the stuff I hold some sentimental value with me for my later life. (step 1)

Step 5: Where the fun ***truly***  begins
If I managed to make it to this point I’d be pretty well off. Money? No issue. Physical? Good enough. Mental? Lotta work has been done on it. Social? My job offer the dosage. Sentimental? Hell yeah.
The question now is more what I *want*  to do rather than what I *has*  to do.
Most of those are outlined by now but I do have some more ideas:
- Vacation can be considered but riding around on a bike to a different town/city for a while also counts so that’s that.
- Adopt a child is also on my mind but that’s very dependent on circumstance.
- Donations to charities and organizations that would help the future world look more like a hospitable environment and less like Mad Max: Fury Road is also good but I have to look closely into each one to make sure they aren’t committing fraud or something.
- Growing a cactus cuz why the heck not.
Other than those I’m confident I can think of a lot of things by then.

Step 6: Endgame
By this step I probably have experienced a fulfilling life. But everything has to end at some point. And I have a plan.
I would’ve calculated so that near the end of my natural lifespan, I’d have used up most of that money, mostly giving it away for various reasons. (I’m not stupid enough for overpriced collectibles.) I’d probably have *just*  enough by the end.
When the time feels right and my body have given the signal, I would go for one last trip. To see the (hopefully) beautiful world. To breathe the (hopefully) fresh air. To see life for one last time. Then I take the two most lethal options I have available to me and use both. Gotta take the ferry to hell before health complications and the dreaded bedridden phase kicks in.
Either that or I have a lame death in my house. We’re 50/50 on that one.

The end.
